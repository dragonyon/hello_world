Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State
*/


//Solution:

select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left out join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;

//Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
